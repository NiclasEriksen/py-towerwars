# py-towerwars
A python implementation of the custom game mode Tower Wars from Warcraft III.

It's built on [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/), [py-lepton](https://code.google.com/p/py-lepton/) (particle system) and [PyTMX](https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX). Most of the assets are free (as in freedom) assets found online.
